## Career Portfolio

### About Me
I am currently studying the sixth semester on Robotics and Digital Systems, on Instituto Tecnol√≥gico y Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, on Mexico.

### Design of a Biometric System for Voice Signals Processing
The goal of this project was to identify different voices using mathematical and statistical functions. This code was done using MATLAB, and allowed users to record their voices and analyze them. The most important function was the Fourier Fourier Transform, to find the most present frequencies. Then, we used statistical analysis to find the differences between the voice recordings, and display graphs and tables.

### Intelligent Platform of Air Pressure Prototype on Agricultural Equiment
The main goal of this project, which we worked on with John Derre, was to implement a controller to allow a bag to inflate or deflate depending on the internal pressure of it, which represented a tire. Using a closed-loop controller, we read the data from the a pressure sensor to determine the internal pressure of the bag, while an air pump and a solenoid valve were turned on and off to let the air flow to or from the bag. We used an STM32 microcontroller to apply the control, including the sensor and the actuators, as well as the LCD display and the CAN, SPI and L2C communication.

Along with this, we also created a digital interface using Arduino Cloud, to view the pressure and determine de desired one. Finally, we used an extra sensor to read the movement of our plant. With this, we used the Fast Fourier Transform to analyze the frequency of the vibrations.

### Growth of a Corporate Network

We used Packet Tracer from Cisco to create a Network of connectivity Devices that represetented a LAN and WAN Network from an Enterprise. We did a Logical and Physical disign, which helped us show how it should be connected in areas or Topologies, and how it would look when done physically. For this, we were given the characteristics of the Enterprise, and with this we could make the calculations to find how many Routers, Switches and Terminal Devices we would need for a given growth. We had to make and IP subdivision and network mask following the protocols given, so we could program these devices to connect with each other depending on the region of the country, and gave them security, names and IP address.

### Cyber-Physic Videogame using an FPGA

I developed a Space Invaders-style video game that utilized an FPGA system.It is controlled by reading an accelerometer through UART communication protocol. When the player wins or loses,it displays an image to an external monitor via VGA. I was responsible for developing the game algorithm. I made sure there was a functional communication between the devices. And run a quality control test on the game functionality. My technical skills in programming languages such as Processing, VHDL, and Verilog were utilized to achieve the project goals.
